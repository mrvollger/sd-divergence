# SD divergence analysis for Vollger et al., 2023

This is a snakemake for analyzing variants from assemblies aligned to CHM13 v1.1. 

See `run.sh` for how to execute. However you will need the pre aligned sequences which you can find on [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6792653).

Dependencies are handled by snakemake and conda.
